# Looking at the API validation options

## Using the `validate` crate 

- Cannot validate enums
- A bit hard to assemble the result into a JSON
- Quite easy to apply basic validations

## From scratch

- Easy to assemble the errors into any format
- Tedious to validate and then map to concrete messages
- Quiute verbose
